# Claude Desktop Debian - Development Notes

## Project Overview

This project repackages Claude Desktop (Electron app) for Debian/Ubuntu Linux, applying necessary patches for Linux compatibility.

## Code Style

All shell scripts in this project must follow the [Bash Style Guide](STYLEGUIDE.md). Key points:

- Tabs for indentation, lines under 80 characters (exception: URLs and regex patterns)
- Use `[[ ]]` for conditionals, `$(...)` for command substitution
- Single quotes for literals, double quotes for expansions
- Lowercase variables; UPPERCASE only for constants/exports
- Use `local` in functions, avoid `set -e` and `eval`

### Linting

Shell scripts are checked with `shellcheck` and GitHub Actions workflows with `actionlint` before pushing. When lint issues are found:

1. **Fix the code** - Correct the underlying issue rather than suppressing the warning
2. **Disable directives are a last resort** - Only use `# shellcheck disable=SCXXXX` when:
   - The warning is a false positive
   - The pattern is intentional and unavoidable
   - Always add a comment explaining why the disable is needed
3. **Run `/lint` to check manually** - Use this skill to check for issues before pushing

## GitHub Workflow

### General Approach

- Use `gh` CLI for all GitHub interactions
- Create branches based on issue numbers: `fix/123-description` or `feature/123-description`
- Reference issues in commits and PRs with `#123` or `Fixes #123`
- After creating a PR, add a comment to the related issue with a summary and link to the PR

### Investigating Issues

For older issues, review the state of the code when the issue was raised - it may have already been addressed:

```bash
# Get issue creation date
gh issue view 123 --json createdAt

# Find the commit just before the issue was created
git log --oneline --until="2025-08-23T08:48:35Z" -1

# View a file at that point in time
git show <commit>:path/to/file.sh

# Search for relevant changes since the issue was created
git log --oneline --after="2025-08-23" -- path/to/file.sh

# View a specific commit that may have fixed the issue
git show <commit>
```

This helps identify if the issue was already fixed, and allows referencing the specific commit in the response.

### Attribution

**For PR descriptions**, include full attribution:

```
---
Generated with [Claude Code](https://claude.ai/code)
Co-Authored-By: Claude <model-name> <noreply@anthropic.com>
<XX>% AI / <YY>% Human
Claude: <what AI did>
Human: <what human did>
```

- Use the actual model name (e.g., `Claude Opus 4.5`, `Claude Sonnet 4`)
- The percentage split should honestly reflect the contribution balance for that specific work
- This provides a trackable record of AI-assisted development over time

**For issues and comments**, use simplified attribution:

```
---
Written by Claude <model-name> via [Claude Code](https://claude.ai/code)
```

**For commits**, include a Co-Authored-By trailer:

```
Co-Authored-By: Claude <claude@anthropic.com>
```

### Contributor Credits

The README Acknowledgments section credits external contributors in chronological order (by merge date or fix date). Update it when:

1. **Merging an external PR** — Add the author to the Acknowledgments list with a link to their GitHub profile and a brief description of their contribution.
2. **Implementing a fix suggested in an issue** — If an issue author (or commenter) provided a concrete fix, workaround, code snippet, or detailed technical analysis that was directly used, credit them too.

Contributors are listed in chronological order: inspirational projects first (k3d3, emsi, leobuskin), then contributors ordered by when their contribution was merged or implemented.

## Working with Minified JavaScript

### Important Guidelines

1. **Always use regex patterns** when modifying the source JavaScript in `build.sh`. Variable and function names are minified and **change between releases**.

2. **The beautified code in `build-reference/` has different spacing** than the actual minified code in the app. Patterns must handle both:
   - Minified: `oe.nativeTheme.on("updated",()=>{`
   - Beautified: `oe.nativeTheme.on("updated", () => {`

3. **Use `-E` flag with sed** for extended regex support when patterns need grouping or alternation.

4. **Extract variable names dynamically** rather than hardcoding them. Example from `build.sh`:
   ```bash
   # Extract function name from a known pattern
   TRAY_FUNC=$(grep -oP 'on\("menuBarEnabled",\(\)=>\{\K\w+(?=\(\)\})' app.asar.contents/.vite/build/index.js)
   ```

5. **Handle optional whitespace** in regex patterns:
   ```bash
   # Bad: assumes no spaces
   sed -i 's/oe.nativeTheme.on("updated",()=>{/...'

   # Good: handles optional whitespace
   sed -i -E 's/(oe\.nativeTheme\.on\(\s*"updated"\s*,\s*\(\)\s*=>\s*\{)/...'
   ```

### Reference Files

- `build-reference/app-extracted/` - Extracted and beautified source for analysis
- `build-reference/tray-icons/` - Tray icon assets for reference

## Frame Fix Wrapper

The app uses a wrapper system to intercept and fix Electron behavior for Linux:

- **`frame-fix-wrapper.js`** - Intercepts `require('electron')` to patch BrowserWindow defaults (e.g., `frame: true` for proper window decorations on Linux)
- **`frame-fix-entry.js`** - Entry point that loads the wrapper before the main app

These are injected by `build.sh` and referenced in `package.json`'s `main` field. The wrapper pattern allows fixing Electron behavior without modifying the minified app code directly.

## Setting Up build-reference

If `build-reference/` is missing or you need to inspect source for a new version, follow these steps to download, extract, and beautify the source code.

### Prerequisites

```bash
# Install required tools
sudo apt install p7zip-full wget nodejs npm

# Install asar and prettier globally (or use npx)
npm install -g @electron/asar prettier
```

### Step 1: Download the Windows Installer

The Windows installer contains the app.asar which has the full Electron app source.

```bash
# Create working directory
mkdir -p build-reference && cd build-reference

# Download URL pattern (update version as needed):
# x64: https://downloads.claude.ai/releases/win32/x64/VERSION/Claude-COMMIT.exe
# arm64: https://downloads.claude.ai/releases/win32/arm64/VERSION/Claude-COMMIT.exe

# Example for version 1.1.381:
wget -O Claude-Setup-x64.exe "https://downloads.claude.ai/releases/win32/x64/1.1.381/Claude-c2a39e9c82f5a4d51f511f53f532afd276312731.exe"
```

### Step 2: Extract the Installer

```bash
# Extract the exe (it's a 7z archive)
7z x -y Claude-Setup-x64.exe -o"exe-contents"

# Find and extract the nupkg
cd exe-contents
NUPKG=$(find . -name "AnthropicClaude-*.nupkg" | head -1)
7z x -y "$NUPKG" -o"nupkg-contents"
cd ..

# Copy out the important files
cp exe-contents/nupkg-contents/lib/net45/resources/app.asar .
cp -a exe-contents/nupkg-contents/lib/net45/resources/app.asar.unpacked .

# Optional: copy tray icons for reference
mkdir -p tray-icons
cp exe-contents/nupkg-contents/lib/net45/resources/*.png tray-icons/ 2>/dev/null || true
cp exe-contents/nupkg-contents/lib/net45/resources/*.ico tray-icons/ 2>/dev/null || true
```

### Step 3: Extract app.asar

```bash
# Extract the asar archive
asar extract app.asar app-extracted
```

### Step 4: Beautify the JavaScript Files

The extracted JS files are minified. Use prettier to make them readable:

```bash
# Beautify all JS files in the build directory
npx prettier --write "app-extracted/.vite/build/*.js"

# Or beautify specific files
npx prettier --write app-extracted/.vite/build/index.js
npx prettier --write app-extracted/.vite/build/mainWindow.js
```

### Step 5: Clean Up (Optional)

```bash
# Remove intermediate files, keep only what's needed for reference
rm -rf exe-contents
rm Claude-Setup-x64.exe
rm -rf app.asar app.asar.unpacked  # Keep only app-extracted
```

### Final Structure

```

```

## Adding New Package Formats or Repositories

When adding support for new distribution formats (e.g., RPM, Flatpak, Snap) or package repositories, follow these guidelines to avoid iterative debugging in CI.

### Research Before Implementing

1. **Understand the target system's constraints** - Each package format has specific rules:
   - Version string formats (e.g., RPM cannot have hyphens in Version field)
   - Required metadata fields
   - Signing requirements and tools

2. **Search for existing CI implementations** - Look for "GitHub Actions [format] signing" or similar. Existing workflows reveal required flags, environment setup, and common pitfalls.

3. **Check tool behavior in non-interactive environments** - CI has no TTY. Tools like GPG need flags like `--batch` and `--yes` to work without prompts.

### Consider Concurrency

1. **Multiple jobs writing to the same branch will race** - If APT and DNF repos both push to `gh-pages`, add:
   - Job dependencies (`needs: [other-job]`), or
   - Retry loops with `git pull --rebase` before push

2. **External processes may also modify branches** - GitHub Pages deployment runs automatically and can cause push conflicts.

### Test the Full Pipeline

1. **Test CI steps locally first** - Run the signing/packaging commands manually to catch errors before committing.

2. **Use a test tag for new infrastructure** - Create a non-release tag to validate the full CI pipeline before merging to main.

3. **Verify the end-user experience** - After CI succeeds, actually test the install commands from the README on a clean system.

### Common CI Pitfalls

| Issue | Solution |
|-------|----------|
| GPG "cannot open /dev/tty" | Add `--batch` flag |
| GPG "File exists" error | Add `--yes` flag to overwrite |
| Push rejected (ref changed) | Add `git pull --rebase` before push, with retry loop |
| Version format invalid | Research target format's version constraints upfront |
| Signing key not found | Ensure key is imported before signing step, check key ID output |

## CI/CD

### Triggering Builds

```bash
# Trigger CI on a branch
gh workflow run CI --ref branch-name

# Watch the run
gh run watch RUN_ID

# Download artifacts
gh run download RUN_ID -n artifact-name
```

### Build Artifacts

- `claude-desktop-VERSION-amd64.deb` - Debian package for x86_64
- `claude-desktop-VERSION-amd64.AppImage` - AppImage for x86_64
- `claude-desktop-VERSION-arm64.deb` - Debian package for ARM64
- `claude-desktop-VERSION-arm64.AppImage` - AppImage for ARM64
- `result/` - Nix build output (symlink, gitignored)

## Testing

### Local Build

```bash
./build.sh --build appimage --clean no
```

### Nix Build

```bash
nix build .#claude-desktop
nix build .#claude-desktop-fhs
```

### Testing AppImage

```bash
# Run with logging
./test-build/claude-desktop-*.AppImage 2>&1 | tee ~/.cache/claude-desktop-debian/launcher.log
```

## Debugging Workflow

### Inspecting the Running App's Code

```bash
# Find the mounted AppImage path
mount | grep claude
# Example: /tmp/.mount_claudeXXXXXX

# Extract the running app's asar for inspection
npx asar extract /tmp/.mount_claudeXXXXXX/usr/lib/node_modules/electron/dist/resources/app.asar /tmp/claude-inspect

# Search for patterns in the extracted code
grep -n "pattern" /tmp/claude-inspect/.vite/build/index.js
```

### Checking DBus/Tray Status

```bash
# List registered tray icons
gdbus call --session --dest=org.kde.StatusNotifierWatcher \
  --object-path=/StatusNotifierWatcher \
  --method=org.freedesktop.DBus.Properties.Get \
  org.kde.StatusNotifierWatcher RegisteredStatusNotifierItems

# Find which process owns a DBus connection
gdbus call --session --dest=org.freedesktop.DBus \
  --object-path=/org/freedesktop/DBus \
  --method=org.freedesktop.DBus.GetConnectionUnixProcessID ":1.XXXX"
```

### Log Locations

- Launcher log: `~/.cache/claude-desktop-debian/launcher.log`
- App logs: `~/.config/Claude/logs/`
- Run with logging: `./app.AppImage 2>&1 | tee ~/.cache/claude-desktop-debian/launcher.log`

## Useful Locations

- App data: `~/.config/Claude/`
- Logs: `~/.config/Claude/logs/`
- SingletonLock: `~/.config/Claude/SingletonLock`
- Launcher log: `~/.cache/claude-desktop-debian/launcher.log`

## Versioning

Release versions are managed via two GitHub Actions repository variables (not files):

- **`REPO_VERSION`** - The project's own version (e.g., `1.3.23`). Bump this manually via `gh variable set REPO_VERSION --body "X.Y.Z"` when shipping project changes.
- **`CLAUDE_DESKTOP_VERSION`** - The upstream Claude Desktop version (e.g., `1.1.8629`). Updated automatically by the `check-claude-version` workflow when a new upstream release is detected.

### Tag format

Tags follow the pattern `v{REPO_VERSION}+claude{CLAUDE_DESKTOP_VERSION}`, e.g., `v1.3.23+claude1.1.7714`. Pushing a tag triggers the CI release build.

```bash
# Check current values
gh variable get REPO_VERSION
gh variable get CLAUDE_DESKTOP_VERSION

# Bump repo version and tag a release
gh variable set REPO_VERSION --body "1.3.24"
git tag "v1.3.24+claude$(gh variable get CLAUDE_DESKTOP_VERSION)"
git push origin "v1.3.24+claude$(gh variable get CLAUDE_DESKTOP_VERSION)"
```

When upstream Claude Desktop updates, the `check-claude-version` workflow automatically updates `CLAUDE_DESKTOP_VERSION`, patches `build.sh` URLs, and creates a new tag — no manual intervention needed.

## Common Gotchas

- **`.zsync` files** - Used for delta updates, can be ignored/deleted
- **AppImage mount points** - Running AppImages mount to `/tmp/.mount_claude*`; check with `mount | grep claude`
- **Killing the app** - Must kill all electron child processes, not just the main one:
  ```bash
  pkill -9 -f "mount_claude"
  ```
- **SingletonLock** - If app won't start, check for stale lock: `~/.config/Claude/SingletonLock`
- **Node version** - Build requires Node.js; the script downloads its own if needed
- **Nix hashes** - When Claude Desktop version changes, both `build.sh` URLs and `nix/claude-desktop.nix` (version, URLs, SRI hashes) must be updated. The CI handles this automatically.
- **Claude Desktop version** - A GitHub Action automatically updates the `CLAUDE_DESKTOP_VERSION` repo variable and the URLs in `build.sh` on main when a new version is detected. Before committing `build.sh`, ensure your branch has the latest URLs:
  ```bash
  # Check repo variable (source of truth)
  gh variable get CLAUDE_DESKTOP_VERSION

  # Check current version in build.sh
  grep -oP 'x64/\K[0-9]+\.[0-9]+\.[0-9]+' build.sh | head -1

  # If outdated, pull URLs from main branch
  gh api repos/aaddrick/claude-desktop-debian/contents/build.sh?ref=main \
    --jq '.content' | base64 -d | grep -E "CLAUDE_DOWNLOAD_URL=|claude_download_url="
  ```
  Update both amd64 and arm64 URLs in `detect_architecture()` to match main
